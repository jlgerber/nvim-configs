Neo-tree is a plugin that shows up as a tree view off to the left side.
It can be invoked via

```bash
ctrl-n
```

This will open a side pane. You can bounce back and forth just like any other windows via `ctrl-w`

### Bindings

You can press '?' when you are in the neo-tree window to get a list of hotkeys. Some common ones are:

| ---  | --- |
| key  | affect |
| ---  | ---  |
| <cr> | open selected |
| a    | add a new file or directory |
| d    | delete |
| r    | rename |
